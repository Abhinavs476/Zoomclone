This is an audio and video streaming program with screen sharing.

## How to use:
1. Enter the IPV4 address of the local system that you want to connect to.
2. Press "Start listening".
3. Start audio and video steaming.

### This program has a major bug which keeps streaming your AV even after you close the program. To stop streaming, manually stop "Pythom" via task manager.
